User Interface Design and Evaluation

This repository contains files with projects from UI Design and Evaluation.

The first project is a scholarship assignment where we were tasked with creating a webpage concept for students coming into college looking for scholarships.
For the second, we had to transfer part of a paper police crash report into a webpage/application concept for inputting it on a computer.

The third is our big project which I worked on with 5 other people. We had to create a concept for an Augmented Reality app for Moundville Archeological Park.
I created the concept itself which is displayed in wireframes with each page of the app. This is subject to change in the future as we are still working on this project.
